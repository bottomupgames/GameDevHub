# Objectives

> [!TODO] Main objective
> - Draft a list of potential powerups for the “Flying Dinos” game to support variety and strategy in races.

> [!question] Secondary objectives
> - Explore effects that enhance underwater, surface, and flying gameplay equally.
> - Provide a foundation for later prototyping and balancing.

# Description

This task focuses on brainstorming and defining potential powerups that could add depth and excitement to gameplay. Early ideas should balance creativity with feasibility, allowing both designers and programmers to test them quickly in prototype form.

**Steps:**
1. Draft a first list of powerups including **flight extenders, bubble shields, sonic pulses, and speed fins**.
2. Classify each powerup into categories: offensive (sonic pulses), defensive (bubble shields), or utility (flight extenders, speed fins).
3. Annotate the gameplay purpose of each powerup (speed boost, protection, area attack, strategic advantage).
4. Gather feedback from the team on which concepts seem most promising.
5. Refine the list to 6–8 powerups for early prototyping.
6. Document descriptions for clarity before passing to programmers.
