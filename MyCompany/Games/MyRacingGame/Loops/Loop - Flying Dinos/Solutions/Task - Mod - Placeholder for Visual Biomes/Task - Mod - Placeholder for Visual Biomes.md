# Objectives

> [!TODO] Main Objective
> - Create placeholder modules (“mods”) for different visual biomes to quickly prototype level themes.

> [!question] Secondaries Objectives
> - Ensure each biome (reef caverns, volcanic lakes, sunken ruins, sky islands) has distinct placeholder assets.
> - Provide modular pieces that designers can easily rearrange during testing.
> - > - Validate that placeholders communicate intended variety without requiring final art.

# Description
**resources :**
- [[Task - Define Criteria for Distinct Level Design]]


This task focuses on producing temporary environment modules to test visual and gameplay variety across different biomes. The goal is not polished assets but quick, reusable blocks that allow designers to construct levels rapidly and evaluate distinctiveness.

**Steps:**
1. Define 3–4 modular pieces per biome (e.g., coral walls for reefs, lava pillars for volcanic lakes, ruin arches, floating platforms for sky islands).
2. Model rough blockouts with simple textures and colors to differentiate biomes.
3. Import modules into the game engine and build small test tracks for each biome.
4. Validate readability and gameplay flow using placeholder visuals.
5. Collect designer feedback on which modules best support layout experimentation.
6. Document placeholder assets for future replacement with polished art.


# Result

> [!warning] Comments
> - Each biome felt visually distinct even with rough assets.

>[!note] Improvements and ideas
> - [ ] Replace weakest modules with stronger thematic stand-ins.
