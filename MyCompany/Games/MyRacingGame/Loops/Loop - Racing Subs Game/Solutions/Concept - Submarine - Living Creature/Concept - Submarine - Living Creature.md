# Objectives

> [!TODO] Main objective
> - Produce submarine sketches inspired by living creatures such as fish, whales, and dinosaurs, blended with mechanical elements.

> [!question] Secondary objectives
> - Explore how organic silhouettes can merge with technological details to create unique racing submarines.
> - Test which creatures (sharks, whales, plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs) convey speed and power most effectively.
> - Evaluate readability: ensure creature-like subs remain recognizable as vehicles, not just animals.

# Description

This task explores a hybrid design approach where submarines are inspired by marine life or prehistoric creatures. Mechanical parts (engines, cockpits, armor) are integrated into organic forms to create striking and imaginative vehicle silhouettes.

**Steps:**
1. Collect biological references of marine animals (sharks, dolphins, whales) and aquatic dinosaurs (plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs).
2. Sketch organic body shapes adapted into vehicle forms (streamlined fins, tails used as rudders).
3. Integrate mechanical parts: propellers, glowing thrusters, armored plating, cockpit bubbles.
4. Experiment with color palettes blending natural tones (blues, greys, scales) with neon highlights.
5. Produce 4–5 variations showing different degrees of organic-to-mechanical balance.
6. Compile into a presentation sheet for team and audience review.

> [!warning] Comments
> - Dino-sub” sketches became the clear favorite among team members and test audiences.
> - Hybrid forms felt unique, blending natural familiarity with imaginative sci-fi racing flair.

>[!note] Improvements and ideas
> - [x] Focus further iterations on the “swimming dinosaur” aesthetic, which resonated most strongly.[[Concept - Submarine - Living Creature 001]]
> - [ ] Test how different creature-inspired silhouettes impact level readability and hitbox design.
