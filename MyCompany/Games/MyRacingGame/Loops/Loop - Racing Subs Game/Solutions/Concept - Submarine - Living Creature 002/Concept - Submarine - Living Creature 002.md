# Objectives

> [!TODO] Main objective
> - Create submarine sketches that merge the exaggerated, colorful cartoon style with the organic shapes of creature-inspired designs.

> [!question] Secondary objectives
> - Test how playful proportions (big eyes, oversized fins, exaggerated silhouettes) can be combined with animal-inspired bases (fish, whales, dinosaurs).
> - Explore vibrant cartoon color palettes applied to creature-like forms.
> - Validate whether this hybrid direction appeals to both younger and older audiences by balancing whimsy with recognizability.

# Description
>**resources notes :**
>- [[Concept - Submarine - Living Creature 001]]
>- [[Concept - Submarine - Cartoony]]

This task explores a fusion approach, combining the fun and exaggerated look of cartoony submarines with the organic appeal of living creature-inspired subs. The goal is to see if a lighter, more approachable version of the dino-sub or fish-sub design can broaden audience appeal while staying unique.

**Steps:**
1. Gather references from animated films featuring sea creatures and stylized vehicles.
2. Sketch submarines based on animal silhouettes (fish, whales, dinosaurs) with playful exaggeration.
3. Apply bright and vibrant color palettes (reds, yellows, turquoise, lime green).
4. Experiment with expressive “faces” or eye-like features without over-anthropomorphizing.
5. Produce 3–4 variations showing different balances of cartoon exaggeration and creature realism.
6. Compile hybrid sketches into a sheet for team review and audience testing.

> [!warning] Comments
> - Bright colors made the hybrids highly readable against underwater backdrops.
> - Some sketches risked looking too childish, resembling toy mascots.
> - Overly exaggerated features sometimes reduced the impression of speed.
