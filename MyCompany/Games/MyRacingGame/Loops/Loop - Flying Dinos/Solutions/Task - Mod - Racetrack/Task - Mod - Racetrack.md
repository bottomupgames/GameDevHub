>Kanban progress : [[Task - Mod - Racetrack Kanban]]

# Objectives

> [!TODO] Main Objective
> - Build a modular version of a racetrack.

> [!question] Secondaries Objectives
> - Provide reusable modular pieces (curves, straights, ramps, tunnels) to quickly assemble tracks.
> - Ensure placeholder visuals are readable while supporting gameplay iteration.
> - Validate racetrack pacing and flow before committing to final assets.

# Description
> **resources :** 
> - [[Task - RaceTrack - Layout]]
> - [[Concept - Define Distinctiveness Criteria for Racetracks]]


This task focuses on creating a modular racetrack prototype to support early gameplay testing. Instead of a polished environment, blockout modules will be used to assemble different track layouts quickly, allowing the design team to test pacing, readability, and fun factor.

**Steps:**
1. Define a set of base racetrack modules (straight sections, 90° turns, loops, ramps, underwater tunnels).
2. Build placeholder meshes with simple textures and flat colors.
3. Import modules into the engine and assemble at least one test track.
4. Playtest pacing and readability with basic submarine locomotion.
5. Record feedback on flow, challenge, and visibility.
6. Iterate on module proportions (width, curvature, length) based on playtest data.

## 1. Split the road

## 2. Make the mods (**In Progress**)

## 3. Bonus : Little foliage

Sorry I've loose myself and took some days to create this little foliage meshes.... But I gives more the impression that the race track is under water ☺
