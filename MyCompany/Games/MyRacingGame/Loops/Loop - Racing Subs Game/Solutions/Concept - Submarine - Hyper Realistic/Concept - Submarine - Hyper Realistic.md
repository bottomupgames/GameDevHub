# Objectives

> [!TODO] Main objective
> - Produce hyper-realistic submarine sketches with advanced sci-fi details and highly rendered textures.

> [!question] Secondary objectives
> - Explore futuristic design elements (plasma engines, energy shields, holographic cockpits) while keeping submarines recognizable.
> - Showcase fine detail through materials such as reflective alloys, glowing energy conduits, and advanced plating.
> - Evaluate whether hyper-realism enhances immersion or risks making the game feel too serious.

# Description

This task aims to push submarine design into a hyper-realistic sci-fi direction. Unlike cartoony or grounded military styles, these sketches should emphasize intricate surface detail, futuristic technology, and cinematic realism. The goal is to test if this “serious sci-fi” aesthetic resonates with the team and target audience.

**Steps:**
1. Collect reference images of modern submarines, spacecraft, and sci-fi concept art.
2. Sketch submarines with ultra-detailed textures: layered plating, glowing seams, reinforced armor.
3. Integrate advanced technologies: thrusters, shield emitters, holographic elements.
4. Use dramatic lighting (reflections, subsurface scattering) to accentuate realism.
5. Produce 3–4 high-detail concepts to showcase the hyper-realistic style.
6. Compile into a polished presentation sheet for internal and audience review.

> [!warning] Comments
> - Some designs felt too intimidating and clashed with the playful tone of racing.
> - Rendering time and detail requirements may slow down production workflows.

>[!note] Improvements and ideas
> - [ ] Consider merging hyper-realistic surface textures with exaggerated racing silhouettes.
