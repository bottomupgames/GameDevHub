# Description
> **resources :** 
> - [[Task - Shader - Water Distortion]]


This task is about stress-testing a full-screen shader that simulates underwater wavy refraction. The goal is to measure its performance impact, identify bottlenecks, and determine if the effect is viable for gameplay use.

**Steps:**
1. Implement the full-screen refraction shader with adjustable intensity.
2. Run benchmarks on different hardware tiers (low, mid, high).
3. Record frame rates, GPU utilization, and CPU overhead.
4. Compare results between single-player and splitscreen setups.
5. Document findings and propose optimization strategies.


# Results

> [!warning] Comments
> - High GPU load on mid-tier hardware caused frame rate drops.
> - Full-screen distortion was distracting in competitive gameplay tests.

>[!note] Improvements and ideas
> - [ ] Explore partial-screen distortion instead of full coverage.
