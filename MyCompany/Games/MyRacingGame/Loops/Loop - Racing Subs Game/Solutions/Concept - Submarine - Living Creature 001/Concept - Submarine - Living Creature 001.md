# Objectives

> [!TODO] Main objective
> - Refine submarine concepts by focusing on the “swimming dinosaur” aesthetic, which gained the strongest positive reaction.

> [!question] Secondary objectives
> - Explore variations of aquatic dinosaur forms (plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs) adapted into racing vehicles.
> - Experiment with the integration of mechanical details (cockpits, thrusters, armor plating) without losing the organic creature feel.
> - Test which silhouettes convey both prehistoric power and futuristic racing speed.

# Description
**comes from : [[Concept - Submarine - Living Creature]]**

This task aims to deepen the exploration of the dinosaur-inspired submarine style that resonated most with both the team and test audiences. Designs will blend prehistoric animal shapes with mechanical engineering to produce a unique, iconic racing aesthetic.

**Steps:**
1. Research aquatic dinosaurs and large marine reptiles for distinctive body plans.
2. Sketch 4–5 new concepts exaggerating dinosaur-like features (long necks, tails, fins).
3. Integrate mechanical elements such as bubble cockpits, neon thrusters, and armored plating.
4. Test different levels of mechanical integration (more creature-like vs. more machine-like).
5. Compile iterations into a visual sheet for comparison and voting.
6. Share results with the team and survey target audience for feedback.

> [!warning] Comments
