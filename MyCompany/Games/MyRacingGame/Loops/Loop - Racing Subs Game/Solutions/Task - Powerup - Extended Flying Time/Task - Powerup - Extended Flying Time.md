# Objectives

> [!TODO] Main Objective
> - Place holder powerups that temporarily extend submarine flying time, creating strategic advantages in races.

> [!question] Secondaries Objectives
> - Test different types of powerups (energy orbs, boost rings, consumable pickups).
> - Balance powerup duration so extended flight feels rewarding but not overpowered.

# Description

## Description

This task explores how powerups can enhance the excitement of airborne racing segments. By giving players the ability to extend their time above the water, designers can introduce high-risk, high-reward strategies. The focus is on quick, placeholder prototypes rather than polished assets.

**Steps:**
1. Design 2â€“3 placeholder powerup concepts (glowing orb, energy crystal, speed ring).
2. Implement temporary effects that add seconds to airborne duration.
3. Place powerups at key points near water exits to encourage risky collection paths.
4. Playtest balance: short vs. long extensions (e.g., +2s vs. +5s).
5. Gather player feedback on whether extended flight feels exciting or unfair.
6. Adjust powerup spawn rate and placement for optimal race flow.

> [!warning] Comments
> - Risky placement encouraged creative racing lines.
> - Long extensions broke pacing and caused imbalance.

>[!note] Improvements and ideas
> - [ ] Create some Powerup 3D mods
