# Objectives

> [!important] Main objective
> - Produce mood boards that mix submarine technology with fantasy-inspired elements for racetrack environments.

> [!question] Secondaries ojbectives
> - Which submarine technologies (sonar, hulls, propellers, control panels) translate best into visual motifs?
> - What fantasy elements (bioluminescent corals, glowing ruins, mythical sea creatures) enhance immersion without confusing gameplay readability?
> - How to balance realism and stylization for a coherent visual direction?

# Description

The task is to generate mood boards that establish the artistic direction of underwater racetracks by blending submarine tech references with fantasy elements. These mood boards will serve as a visual foundation for concept sketches and environment design.

**Steps:**
1. Gather references of real submarine interiors, exteriors, and technical equipment (engines, sonar screens, metallic textures).
2. Collect fantasy references such as glowing corals, ancient submerged temples, and mythical underwater fauna.
3. Experiment with collage compositions that juxtapose technical submarine design with magical bioluminescent or crystalline shapes.
4. Test contrasting color palettes (rusty metal vs. vibrant fantasy neon) to explore different moods.
5. Produce 3–4 curated mood boards highlighting distinct directions (e.g., “Industrial Abyss,” “Bioluminescent Ruins,” “Crystal Trenches,” “Sunken Temple Tech”).

> [!warning] Comments
> - Strong contrast between mechanical submarine parts and glowing organic fantasy elements created exciting hybrid aesthetics.
> - Overuse of fantasy elements led to loss of clarity in some boards (e.g., excessive coral clutter).
