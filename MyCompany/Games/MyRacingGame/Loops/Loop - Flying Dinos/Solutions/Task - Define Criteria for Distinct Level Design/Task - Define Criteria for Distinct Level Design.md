# Objectives

> [!TODO] Main Objective
> - Define clear criteria for what makes a level “distinct” in the “Flying Dinos” game.

> [!question] Secondaries Objectives
> - Establish guidelines for visual identity (theme, color palette, environmental features).
> - Identify obstacle types that differentiate gameplay challenges across levels.
> - Determine how powerup placement creates unique strategies in each track.

# Description
**resources :**
- [[Concept - Level - Theme Exploration]]


This task aims to formalize the rules that ensure every racing level feels unique while maintaining consistency with the overall game identity. By setting criteria for visuals, obstacles, and powerup placement, designers can avoid repetition and maximize replayability.

**Steps:**
1. Analyze reference levels from existing racing and action games for distinctiveness.
2. Draft a list of visual identity markers (lighting, terrain type, landmark objects).
3. Brainstorm obstacle types suited to different environments (reefs, lava flows, collapsing ruins, air currents).
4. Create guidelines for powerup placement: balance risk/reward, encourage exploration, support pacing.
5. Compile findings into a “Distinct Level Design Criteria” document for the design team.
6. Validate criteria against initial themes (reef caverns, volcanic lakes, sunken ruins, sky islands).
