# Description
**resourses :** 
- [[Concept - Powerup]]


This task focuses on implementing temporary versions of the drafted powerups. Each powerup will receive a basic UI icon for player recognition and simple in-game logic to simulate its effect. The goal is not polish, but functionality to support prototyping and playtesting.

**Steps:**
1. Design simple 2D icons (circle, triangle, color-coded shapes) for each powerup.
2. Assign placeholder colors (e.g., blue = shield, red = attack, green = speed).
3. Implement minimal logic for each:
    - **Flight extender:** add seconds to flying duration.
    - **Bubble shield:** block one attack.
    - **Sonic pulse:** area knockback.
    - **Speed fins:** short burst of extra speed.
4. Integrate icons into HUD for clear pickup feedback.
5. Test powerups in a simple track environment.
6. Document feedback on clarity and functionality.
