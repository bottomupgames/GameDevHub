# Description
The task is to document the results of previous palette tests into a usable reference guide. This document will serve as a standard for visual consistency across underwater racetrack environments.

**Steps:**

1. Summarize test outcomes from glow path readability studies.
2. Define primary colors (lime green, cyan) and secondary options (yellow, magenta).
3. Specify bloom intensity ranges and shader parameters for water diffusion.
4. Create visual swatches for each color in context (clear water, murky water, deep-sea).
5. Compile all materials into a single PDF/Obsidian note for cross-department reference.
