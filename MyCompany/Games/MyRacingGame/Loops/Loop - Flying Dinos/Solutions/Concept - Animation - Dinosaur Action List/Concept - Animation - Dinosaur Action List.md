# Objectives

> [!TODO] Main objective
> - Create a comprehensive list of all dinosaur actions that require animation for the “Flying Dinos” prototype.

> [!question] Secondary objectives
> - Ensure the list covers all core gameplay states (underwater, surface, flying).
> - Identify combat-related animations (attacks, taking damage) needed for weapons testing.
> - Highlight shared animations that could be reused across multiple dino types to optimize production.

# Description

This task is about producing a structured animation requirements list before scheduling or prototyping begins. The goal is to anticipate the full scope of work for animators and determine whether the workload is feasible within the production timeline.

**Steps:**
1. Break down movement-related actions (swimming strokes, diving transitions, gliding, flying boosts).
2. Add combat-related actions (attacking, taking damage, stunned states).
3. Include utility animations (idle, victory pose, respawn).
4. Cross-check with designers to confirm which actions are critical for the prototype.
5. Organize the list into a shared document for animation scheduling.
