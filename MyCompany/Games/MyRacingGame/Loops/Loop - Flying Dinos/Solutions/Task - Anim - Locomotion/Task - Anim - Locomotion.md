# Objectives

> [!TODO] Main Objective
> - Create locomotion animations for dinosaur racers, covering both underwater and aerial movement.

> [!question] Secondaries Objectives
> - Ensure swimming animations feel weighty and fluid while gliding/flying feels agile and fast.
> - Define how transitions (swimming → diving → gliding → flying) blend smoothly.

# Description
**resources :**
- [[Concept - Animation - Dinosaur Action List]]


This task focuses on developing the foundational locomotion animations for dinosaur characters in the “Flying Dinos” game. These animations will establish the basic movement feel across multiple environments: underwater, surface, and flying in the air.

**Steps:**
1. Create a movement reference list (idle swim, fast swim, dive, glide, wing flap, aerial boost).
2. Block out placeholder animations using simple rigs.
3. Test blending between underwater swimming and surface/glide transitions.
4. Refine aerial locomotion to emphasize speed and momentum.
5. Export animations to the engine and integrate with prototype controls.
6. Collect feedback from designers and programmers to validate responsiveness.

> [!warning] Comments
> - Transitions between states worked in early tests, giving dinos a dynamic feel.
> - Wing flaps felt repetitive and required variation for realism.
