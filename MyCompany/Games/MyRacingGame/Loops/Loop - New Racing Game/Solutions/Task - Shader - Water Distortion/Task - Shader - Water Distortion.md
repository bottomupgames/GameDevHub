# Objectives

> [!important] Main Objective
> - Implement a simple shader that simulates underwater distortion for racetrack environments.

> [!question] Secondaries Objectives
> - 

# Description




# Results
![[underwater_racd2208_1.jpg]]
> [!warning] Comments
> - Shader gave an immediate impression of being underwater.
> - Full-screen distortion was too CPU heavy and visually distracting.

>[!note] Improvements and ideas
> - [x] Optimize shader for splitscreen performance.[[Task - Benchmarking - Wavy Refraction]]
> - [ ] Provide adjustable intensity settings for level designers.
> - [ ] Combine with particle FX (bubbles, silt clouds) for enhanced immersion.
