# Objectives

> [!TODO] Main objective
> - Produce cartoony-style submarine sketches with exaggerated shapes and bright colors to test audience appeal.

> [!question] Secondary objectives
> - Identify which exaggerated features (oversized fins, bubble canopies, glowing exhausts) enhance the sense of fun.
> - Explore color palettes that remain readable underwater while feeling playful.
> - Evaluate whether these sketches risk alienating older players by being “too childish.”

# Description

The task is to explore a cartoony visual direction for racing submarines. Exaggeration and color play are emphasized over realism, in order to assess how a lighter, fun style could shape the overall tone of the game.

**Steps:**
1. Collect inspiration from animated films, comic-book vehicles, and toy submarines.
2. Sketch submarines with oversized features (propellers, fins, cockpits).
3. Use vibrant color palettes (yellow, red, lime green, turquoise).
4. Produce a series of 5–6 variations with different proportions and silhouettes.
5. Compile sketches into a presentation sheet for team voting.
