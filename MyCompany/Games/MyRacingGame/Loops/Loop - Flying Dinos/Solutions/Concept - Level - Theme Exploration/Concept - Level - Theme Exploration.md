# Objectives

> [!TODO] Main objective
> - Explore and define potential level themes for the “Flying Dinos” game: reef caverns, volcanic lakes, sunken ruins, and sky islands.

> [!question] Secondary objectives
> - Provide distinct visual identities for each theme to ensure variety between levels.
> - Identify gameplay opportunities tied to each environment (verticality, hazards, shortcuts).
> - Validate which themes can be produced efficiently within the project scope.

# Description

This task focuses on brainstorming and visualizing possible environments for racing tracks in the “Flying Dinos” game. Each theme should highlight unique aesthetics and gameplay opportunities while contributing to an overall cohesive world.

**Steps:**
1. Collect visual references for reef caverns, volcanic lakes, ancient underwater ruins, and floating sky islands.
2. Produce quick sketches or mood boards for each theme.
3. Annotate potential gameplay elements (reefs as obstacles, lava flows as hazards, ruins as tunnels, islands as aerial shortcuts).
4. Compare themes in terms of readability, gameplay variety, and production feasibility.
5. Present the four themes side-by-side for team discussion and selection.
