# GameDevHub

You will find here our **Obsidian Vault** template designed for small teams (1–10 members)  in the context of Video Game Development. It helps you stay organized with **project management**, **documentation** and **team communication** all in one place. 

This was made for a **Lunch & Learn** from [games.brussels](https://games.brussels/), built with love at **BottomUpGames**, inspired by Jesse Schell’s _The Art of Game Design_.

We really encourage you to create your own Vault and get familiar with how it works.

Then **Look into this Vault** :

![[GDH Structure Exemple.canvas]]

### 1. Game Exemple
We’ve included a fake game, [[My Racing Game]], to show how it works with some content. It's based on the exemple found in the *chapiter 8* of Jesse Schell’s *The Art of Game Design*.
It’s composed of templates (Game → Loops → Solutions).

Exemples :
- The Game : [[My Racing Game]]
- A Loop : [[Loop - Flying Dinos]]
- A Concept : [[Concept - Submarine - Living Creature 002]]
- A Prototype : [[Proto - Gameplay - Missile Tracking]]
- A Task : [[Task - Color - Palette - Underwater]]

### 2. Weekly
The **Weekly** note gives every team member a quick overview of all active Games, Loops, and Solutions. It highlights schedule overruns with graphs and helps share knowledge, avoiding endless meetings.

Example: [2025-W39](2025-W39.md)

### 3. GDD
An **empty `GDD` folder** under `MyRacingGame` is ready for you to use.

You can make it yours by:
- Creating your own GDD templates and buttons (see `/_system/Templates/...`)  
- Evolving it with your tasks by using tags (e.g. `#GDD`)
- Adding your own notes or visual canvases through:
  - Custom plugins
  - Standalone scripts (examples in `/_system/Scripts`)
  - AI assistance
  - ...

# Make your own GDH

We strongly encourage you to **create your own Game Dev Hub from scratch**.

Some tips:
- Explore Obsidian’s possibilities:
  - Core & Community Plugins
  - Mermaid diagrams
  - …
- Define and embrace your company’s pillars
- Bring in your own inspirations
- Listen to your team
- Don’t assume it’s ever “finished” — keep evolving it!
