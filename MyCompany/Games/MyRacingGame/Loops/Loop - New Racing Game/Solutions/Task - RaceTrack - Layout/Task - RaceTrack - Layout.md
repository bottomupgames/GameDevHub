# Objectives

> [!important] Main Objective
> - Create top-down layouts of racetracks with split paths and shortcuts to evaluate gameplay flow.

> [!question] Secondaries Objectives
> - Find some shortcut designs reward risk-taking without unbalancing the race.
> - Do paths reconnect to keep races competitive.

# Description

The task is to sketch paper-based, top-down layouts of racetracks. These will be used for early gameplay evaluation before moving into digital prototyping.

**Steps:**
1. Collect references of classic racing tracks with branching paths.
2. Draw initial paper layouts featuring 2â€“3 split paths per circuit.
3. Experiment with shortcut placement (minefields, tunnels, risky jumps).
4. Highlight intersections and reconnection points to balance race pacing.
5. Annotate sketches with notes on flow, obstacles, and potential hazards.
