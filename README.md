# GameDevHub
You will find here our **Obsidian Vault** with our solution to help a team (1-10 members) in the context of Video Game Development.

This was made for a **Lunch & Learn** from [games.brussels](https://games.brussels/).

# What is it ?
This Obsidian Vault is a sample of how we made our own **Game Dev Hub** at **BottomUpGames** based on our tree pillars (Bottom up, Shared experience, Aesthetic) and the book of Jesse Schell "The Art of Game Design". 

It is designed to enabling us to adapt to the fast-paced demands of video game production through :
- project management
- documentation
- communication with team members


# Where to start ?
First of all **Discover Obsidian by yourself**. Obsidian is a free software that allow a wide range of taking notes. We really invite you to create your own Vault and understand by yourself how it works.

- [Obsidian Website](https://help.obsidian.md/)
- [Youtube Tutorials](https://youtu.be/OUrOfIqvGS4?si=PHphg4gXKw_BQOXi)

Then **Look into this Vault** :

### 1. Game Exemple
We've made a fake game ([[My Racing Game]]) as exemple to show how it works with some content. It's based on the exemple found in the *chapiter 8* of *The Art of Game Design*. It composed by some templates : Game > Loops > Solutions .

Some Links :
- The Game : [[My Racing Game]]
- A Loop : [[Loop - Flying Dinos]]
- A Concept : [[Concept - Submarine - Living Creature 002]]
- A Prototype : [[Proto - Gameplay - Missile Tracking]]
- A Task : [[Task - Color - Palette - Underwater]]

### 2. Weekly
A Weekly is a note to help each user to have a quick look and links to every Games, Loops and Solutions that are currently active. It highlight the schedule overrun through the graphs and help with the sharing of knowledge bypassing the useless meetings.

Open an existing weekly : [[2025-W39]]


### 3. GDD
An **empty folder** for a `GDD` under `MyRacingGame` is ready.

Find Your way to make it by :
